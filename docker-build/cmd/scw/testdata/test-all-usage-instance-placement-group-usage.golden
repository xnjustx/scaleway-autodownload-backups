Placement groups allow the user to express a preference regarding
the physical position of a group of instances. It'll let the user
choose to either group instances on the same physical hardware for
best network throughput and low latency or to spread instances on
far away hardware to reduce the risk of physical failure.

The operating mode is selected by a `policy_type`. Two policy
types are available:
  - `low_latency` will group instances on the same hypervisors
  - `max_availability` will spread instances on far away hypervisors

The `policy_type` is set by default to `max_availability`.

For each policy types, one of the two `policy_mode` may be selected:
  - `optional` will start your instances even if the constraint is not respected
  - `enforced` guarantee that if the instance starts, the constraint is respected

The `policy_mode` is set by default to `optional`.
