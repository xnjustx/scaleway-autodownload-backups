This method allows to create a new Kubernetes cluster on an account.

USAGE:
  scw k8s cluster create [arg=value ...]

EXAMPLES:
  Create a Kubernetes cluster named foo with cilium as CNI, in version 1.17.4 and with a pool named default composed of 3 DEV1-M
    scw k8s cluster create name=foo version=1.17.4 pools.0.size=3 pools.0.node-type=DEV1-M pools.0.name=default

  Create a Kubernetes cluster named bar, tagged, calico as CNI, in version 1.17.4 and with a tagged pool named default composed of 2 RENDER-S and autohealing and autoscaling enabled (between 1 and 10 nodes)
    scw k8s cluster create name=bar version=1.17.4 tags.0=tag1 tags.1=tag2 cni=cilium pools.0.size=2 pools.0.node-type=RENDER-S pools.0.min-size=1 pools.0.max-size=10 pools.0.autohealing=true pools.0.autoscaling=true pools.0.tags.0=pooltag1 pools.0.tags.1=pooltag2 pools.0.name=default
