A pool is a set of identical Nodes. A pool has a name, a size (its current number of nodes), nodes number limits (min, max) and a Scaleway instance type.
Changing those limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. Thus, when autoscaling is enabled, the pool will grow or shrink inside those limits, depending on its load.
A "default pool" is automatically created with every cluster.
