User data is a key value store API you can use to provide data from and to your server without authentication.

As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the script scw-generate-ssh-keys which generates SSH server’s host keys then stores their fingerprints as user data under the key “ssh-host-fingerprints”.
This way, we ensure they are really connecting to their Scaleway instance and they are not victim of a man-in-the-middle attack.

There are two endpoints to access user data:
 - **From a running instance**, by using the metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data.
   To enhance security, we only allow user data viewing and editing as root.
   To know if the query is issued by the root user, we only accept queries made from a local port below 1024 (by default, non-root users can’t bind ports below 1024).
   To specify the local port with cURL, use `curl --local-port 1-1024 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`
 - **From the instance API** at using methods described bellow.
