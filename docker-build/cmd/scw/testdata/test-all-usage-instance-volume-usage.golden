A volume is where you store your data inside your instance. It
appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
a filesystem and mount it.

We have two different types of volume (`volume_type`):
  - `l_ssd` is a local block storage: your data is downloaded on
    the hypervisor and you need to power off your instance to attach
    or detach a volume.
  - `b_ssd` is a remote block storage: your data is stored on a
    centralised cluster. You can plug and unplug a volume while
    your instance is running. As of today, `b_ssd` is only available
    for `DEV1`, `GP1` and `RENDER` offers.

Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
  - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
  - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

Each types of volumes is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
changed on demand.

Be wary that when terminating an instance, if you want to keep
your block storage volume, **you must** detach it beforehand you
issue the `terminate` call.

When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.
